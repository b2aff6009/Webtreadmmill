## Introduction

Welcome to WebMill! This application allows you to control your Bluetooth-enabled treadmill directly from your web browser. You can import structured workouts from `.zwo` files (used by platforms like Zwift) or text files from `Intervals.icu` and have the app automatically adjust your treadmill's speed and incline according to the workout plan. You can also take manual control at any time.

All processing is done client-side, meaning your data stays private and the application can even work offline after the initial load.

## Key Features

- **Direct Hardware Control**: Connects to any treadmill that supports the Fitness Machine Service (FTMS) Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol.
- **Workout Importer**: Load custom running workouts from `.zwo` or `.txt` files.
- **Workout Player**: Automatically executes the loaded workout, sending speed and incline commands to the treadmill.
- **Live Dashboard**: See your real-time speed, incline, distance, and heart rate (if available) on a chart.
- **Manual Control**: Adjust speed and incline manually when not running a structured workout.
- **Client-Side Logic**: No server is needed. The entire application runs in your browser.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- A modern web browser that supports Web Bluetooth (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge on desktop or Android).
- A treadmill with Bluetooth FTMS support.
- A workout file in `.zwo` or `.txt` (Intervals.icu) format.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Connect to Your Treadmill

1.  Make sure your treadmill is turned on and Bluetooth is enabled. It should be in a discoverable state.
2.  Click the **"Connect"** button in the top-right corner of the application.
3.  A browser pop-up will appear, showing a list of nearby Bluetooth devices.
4.  Select your treadmill from the list and click **"Pair"**.
5.  Once connected, the status indicator will change to "Connected" with a green icon.

#### Step 2: Load a Workout

1.  On the right-hand side of the screen, you will see the **"Import Workout"** panel.
2.  Click **"Choose File"** and select a `.zwo` or `.txt` file from your computer.
3.  The app will parse the file and display the workout name and its steps in the **Workout Player**.

##### Intervals.icu (.txt) Format

You can import simple text-based workouts from Intervals.icu. The file should have a `.txt` extension and follow a specific format:
- Each line starting with `- ` is a workout step.
- Steps are defined by duration (e.g., `4m`, `30s`) followed by an intensity (e.g., `80% Pace`).
- Interval blocks can be defined with `Nx` (e.g., `10x`) on a line, where the subsequent lines until an empty line are repeated `N` times.

**Example `.txt` file:**
```
- 5m 60% Pace

10x
- 30s 120% Pace
- 30s 50% Pace

- 5m 60% Pace
```
**Note**: The `% Pace` calculation is based on the **Threshold Pace** you set in the app's **Settings** tab. Make sure this is configured correctly before importing `.txt` workouts.


#### Step 3: Control the Workout

Once a workout is loaded and the treadmill is connected:

- **Play**: Click the large **Play** button to start the workout. The app will send the initial speed and incline commands to the treadmill and the timer will start.
- **Pause**: Click the **Pause** button to temporarily stop the workout timer. The treadmill will maintain its current speed and incline. You can resume by clicking **Play** again.
- **Stop**: Click the **Stop** button to end the workout session completely. This will send a stop command to the treadmill and reset the workout player.
- **Reset**: Click the small circular arrow icon next to the workout name to unload the current workout and go back to the workout importer screen.

#### Step 4: Use Manual Controls

If no workout is loaded, or if a workout is paused/stopped, you can use the **Manual Control** panel:

1.  Ensure your treadmill is connected.
2.  Use the `+` and `-` buttons for **Speed** and **Incline** to adjust the treadmill settings in real-time.
3.  The manual controls are automatically disabled when a workout is actively running to prevent conflicts.

## Troubleshooting

- **Cannot Connect to Treadmill**:
    - Ensure your browser supports Web Bluetooth.
    - Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your computer/device.
    - Check that your treadmill is powered on and not connected to another device (like a phone or tablet).
    - Try moving closer to the treadmill to ensure a strong signal.
- **Workout File Fails to Load**:
    - The app supports `.zwo` and `.txt` (Intervals.icu) files.
    - Ensure the file is not corrupted and follows the correct structure. The app will show an error message if the file is invalid.
- **"GATT operation already in progress" errors**:
    - This can happen if commands are sent too quickly. The app has a built-in queue to manage this, but if you see this error, try operating the controls more slowly.
